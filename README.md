Modifies and Enhances Carbine's ChatLog, for Roleplayers

Currently Killroy does 4 things:

1. Formats Say and Emote Chat to be more readable by coloring various roleplay chat conventions (*asterisk emotes*, ((OOC Brackets)), and "inline quotes"))

2. Disables the ChatLog bCrossfaction messaging attribute to make cross faction chat possible in all channels Exiles and Dominion share.

3. Auto Inserts the RP Marker {*} into and sending from the RPOnly mode.

4. Operates a range filter on chat in Say and Emote, limited the chat distance taking occlusion into account.

Killroy is offered as is, with no warranty expressed our implied. Errors can be reported via GITHUB (http://github.com/baslack/Killroy/) or Curse (http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/220130-scchatlog). Killroy is offered completely open source. Chat addon developers are encouraged to fork the project and or include it with their own modifications to enhance their addon. I however do not have the time nor inclination to keep pace with all the addon developers out there, so please do not request me to do so.

Questions and change requests to me, Scriptorium, iam@nimajneb.com
