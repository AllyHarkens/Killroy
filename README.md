Modifies and Enhances Carbine's Chatlog for Roleplayers

Derived from the changes I made to the default Chatlog in SCChatlog, Killroy uses method replacement to modify
the OnChatMessage and OnRolePlayBtn behaviors of ChatLog. In addition, I'm developing so chat formatting
replacements, based of my conversations with user "Togglebutton" at Wildstar Roleplay. I currently intend to
implement automatic emote and say formatting for quotes. Finally, I may do some integration with RPCore to pull
character names from the RPCore data.

Questions and change requests to me, Benjamin A. Slack AKA Scriptorium, iam@nimajneb.com
